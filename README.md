## This is a repository that we can use to investigate technical challenges before building the actual application.

### Anticipated Technical Challenges (so-far):

1. Access the EXIF metadata in the file buffer of a photo, particular for GPS coordinates and when photo was taken.
2. Altering metadata after upload.
3. Investigating most scalable (least expensive) media library/database.
4. Ensuring we’re getting full original file, not compressed.
5. We need to check duplicates.
6. Prevent copying of photos.
7. Check authenticity of siting, up/down voting system, APIs for checks, face recognition software.
8. Build out the bidding/sale platform.
9. Build to be our payment processor (rather depending on stripe).
10. Can we redirect to browser for anything payment/sale.
11. Determine Google/Apple revenue shares, and how it affects our profit margins, and distributions back to original owner.
12. Distribute funds back to original owner.
13. Establishing terms of service, investigate public use rights on images/videos of interest.
14. Preventing screenshot, or other saving of photos/videos from platform.
15. Establish “following” system for celebrities/topics.
16. Generate NFT, or associate some other type of blockchain technology, for each photo/videot to establish ownership (and transfer of ownership) and to generate a unique identifier.
17. Managing HEIF/HEIC to JPEG conversion, and other various image/video types.
18. Discovering behavior of mobile browser file inputs, and whether they are automatically converting images to JPEG, or if they can preserve original file formats.
19. Is piexifjs a library that can be relied upon to read and write EXIF metadata.
20. React Native input differences (does a React Native input behave differently than an html input)
21. Can Flutter be a better development environment(can we build either iOs, Android, Window, MacOs apps from any type of platform(Windows/Mac/Linux)
